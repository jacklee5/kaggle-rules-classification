- Investigate QWEN embedding model
- Idea: pass the qwen embeddings into a lightgbm and see if it achieves better results
- See if the bigger embedding models (4B and 8B improve results)
- Remember to normalize embeddings
- TODO: investigate further how embedding model works - what do query and documents do? and see if it is possible to run locally
